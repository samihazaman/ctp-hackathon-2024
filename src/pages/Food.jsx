                    Food insecurity is defined as having limited access to adequate food due to a lack of money or other resources. 
                    Several recent studies suggest that both two-year and four-year college students are more likely to be food insecure than the general U.S. population, 
                    with college prevalence ranging from 14% to 59%. Food insecure students were more likely to have lower GPAs than their food secure peers.e and nutritious food.
